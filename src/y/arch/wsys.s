# wsys.s -- the Windows half of the arch prelude: the blocks of prelude.s
# that reach the kernel, rewritten for NT direct syscalls.
#
# WHY THIS FILE IS A SEPARATE SET OF BLOCKS rather than a second prelude: a
# path import is flattened into its importer, so a second arch_x64.y could not
# coexist (arch_frame would be defined twice and the second would win). So the
# module is one file with internal dispatch (arch_x64.y arch_windows_lines),
# and this file is the data that dispatch substitutes: each block below
# REPLACES the same-named block of prelude.s when the target is Windows. The
# blocks are named exactly as the ones they replace because prelude.s's own
# code calls them; the extra helpers (y_os_*) are private and are only ever
# called from inside the replacement blocks, so the tree shaker keeps them
# when -- and only when -- the block that calls them is kept.
#
# THE CONVENTION, once, for every block below:
#   mov  $number, %eax          the syscall's index
#   arg1 %r10  arg2 %rdx  arg3 %r8  arg4 %r9   arg5+ on the stack at 40(%rsp),
#   48(%rsp), 56(%rsp)...
#   the result is an NTSTATUS in %rax, and FAILURE IS THE POSITIVE SIGN BIT
#   of its low 32 bits: `test %eax,%eax; js` is the failure test. Carrying a
#   SysV `js`/`>= 0` over would read failure as success, and testing %rax
#   instead of %eax would too -- writing EAX clears the high half, so a
#   failure status arrives as a POSITIVE 64-bit value.
#
# WHY THOSE REGISTERS, since "r10/r9/r8/rdx then rcx/r11" is a natural
# mistake and an earlier revision of this file made it: the caller of a
# syscall is ntdll, and ntdll is a Win64 function.  Its own generated stubs
# expand to exactly
#       mov $number, %eax
#       mov %rcx, %r10
#       syscall
# ONE shuffle, because `syscall` destroys %rcx (so argument one must move out
# of it) and leaves everything else alone.  Arguments two, three and four are
# already in %rdx, %r8, %r9, and argument five onwards are already in ntdll's
# shadow space at 40(%rsp) and up -- which is where the kernel reads them,
# because they are the same slots ntdll's caller wrote them into.  Any other
# register set would mean shuffling arguments ntdll has already placed
# correctly, which is the test: if a layout needs more than one instruction in
# ntdll's stub, it is not the layout ntdll uses.
#
# ARGUMENTS FIVE AND UP are on the stack at 40(%rsp), 48(%rsp), ... (see the
# convention above), which is this runtime's own frame -- the 32 bytes below
# that are the shadow space a Win64 callee may read its register arguments
# out of, and nothing here is a real Win64 callee, so nothing has to reserve
# that part for a callee to read.
#
# There is no second opinion encoded here. An earlier revision of this file
# duplicated every argument into both a register and a stack slot "because
# wine needs it"; that is contorting Windows code around a runtime that is
# not the target, and it cannot even be self-consistent (it would put arg5 at
# arg7's slot). It is gone. If a call here is wrong, the call is wrong.
#
# The numbers are the Windows 10 1607 / 11 x64 table, pinned in
# arch_x64.y w_sysno (one arm per call, so a future Windows is a small diff).
# They were read off the syscall stubs in a real ntdll's .text, not written
# from memory: a leftover Linux number silently calls a different, real Nt
# function, which is why that table is one list a review can read at once.
#
# THE FRAME, once, because every block below that calls another one needs it:
# y_os_write and y_os_exit take their arguments ON THE STACK (see y_os_write),
# and so does every Y function, so the two agree and the emitter's pushes land
# where the callee looks. The trap stubs, which are reached by a `jmp` and so
# arrive on the SysV register set, marshal by hand.
#
# THE PUSH ORDER, which the trap stubs below must match exactly: the
# descriptor, then the bytes, then the count -- so the COUNT is the lowest of
# the three and lands at 16(%rbp) inside y_os_write, the bytes at 24 and the
# descriptor at 32. This is the order the emitter's os_write uses (native.y),
# which is the definition; a stub that pushes the other way round hands
# y_os_write the byte count as the file's HANDLE, which is silent -- the call
# returns some other status and the program exits having printed nothing.
#
# y_os_exit takes its status ON THE STACK too (see its own comment), so these
# stubs push it and pop afterwards rather than leaving it in %rdi.
#
# NO `push $immediate`: the in-tree assembler has no push-immediate form --
# ir.y gives F_PUSH_R kinds [O_REG] and nothing else -- so a `push $1` in one
# of these blocks is "push needs r64" at assembly time, a diagnostic that names
# the instruction rather than the missing form. The trap stubs go through %rax
# for it, which is what every other call site in the tree does.
#
# A block here must NOT assume a callee-saved register survives it. Win64 makes
# %rbx, %r12, %r13, %r14 and %r15 callee-saved; these blocks push and pop their
# own, and y_os_write's own prologue pushes %r13 -- which is why the byte
# counts below are 16/24/32(%rbp) and not the SysV registers. Getting that
# wrong is silent: the block runs, and reads a count of 2 because it read back
# a return address.
#
# y_os_handle: fd (%rdi, 0/1/2) -> the process's standard I/O handle. %gs:0x60
# is the PEB on x64 -- stable, unlike TEB.ThreadLocalStoragePointer across
# versions -- PEB+0x20 is ProcessParameters, and RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS
# holds StandardInput/Output/Error at +0x20/+0x28/+0x30. This is the one PEB
# read in the tree, and it exists because a "fd" is not a handle on Windows.
# A syscall per write, which is the cost of having no imports at all.
#=== add: y_os_handle ===
# Every displacement below is DECIMAL (96, 32, 48) and not the hex a reader
# would expect, because the in-tree assembler's number reader is decimal
# (parse_num in asm.y). A hex literal here is a "bad operand" with a
# diagnostic naming the instruction rather than the literal, and it cost a
# session to find because the block had never been reachable: until `print`
# went through y_os_write, nothing a program could call reached y_os_handle.
# 96 is the PEB on x64; PEB+32/+48 are ProcessParameters->StandardInput and
# ->StandardOutput. (Whole-line `#` comments are allowed in this file only
# because the arch module strips them; an indented one reaches the assembler,
# which has no comment syntax of its own.)

# y_os_write(fd, buf, len) -> bytes written, or -1. This REPLACES the
# prelude's write(2) version rather than adding a second one, because it is the
# same entry point: rt.y's y_put_hstr reaches it through the os_write
# intrinsic, so shared std code names one label and the arch module decides
# which kernel call it is. (It was an `add:` block before y_os_write existed in
# prelude.s, when only the trap stubs called it.)
# NtWriteFile takes NINE arguments, which is why it is the call that needs the
# stack slots: handle, event, ApcRoutine, ApcContext, IoStatusBlock, buffer,
# length, offset, key. Four go in registers and the last five at 40(%rsp)
# upwards -- which is why the frame reserves 128 bytes below %rsp here.
# Offset and key are NULL, which is what a console or a pipe wants; the byte
# count comes back in the IO_STATUS_BLOCK's Information field, not in the
# status.  The IO_STATUS_BLOCK lives at -16(%rbp), Information at -8(%rbp).
# y_os_write's three arguments are on the STACK, not in %rdi/%rsi/%rdx: the
# emitter pushes them (os_write in native.y) and a `call` does not put
# arguments in registers. The emitter pushes them left to right, so the COUNT
# -- pushed last -- is the lowest of the three and sits just above the return
# address: 16(%rbp) is the count, 24(%rbp) the bytes and 32(%rbp) the
# descriptor. That is the same rbp+16+8*(n-1-k) layout every Y function uses,
# read right to left, and getting it backwards is silent -- y_os_write still
# runs, and writes a descriptor-sized chunk of whatever the stack held. The
# prelude's version reads the same three off %rsp directly, which is why its
# numbers are 8 lower: it has no frame.
# y_os_write's epilogue restores the three saved registers with explicit loads
# rather than pops. They were pushed AFTER `push %rbp`, so they sit BELOW %rbp
# (-8, -16, -24) while the return address and the three stack arguments sit
# above it -- and a pop-based epilogue after `mov %rbp,%rsp` walks up from the
# saved frame pointer instead, handing %r13 the old %rbp, %rbp %r12, and
# returning into %r13. The symptom is why this is written down: the program
# printed its whole output correctly and then faulted executing address 1,
# which is %r13 holding a stack address. `mov %rbp,%rsp; pop %rbp; ret` is
# right for the two other blocks here, which push nothing between the frame
# pointer and the `sub`.
